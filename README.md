I have no idea what license I should put the games under, but if you get your hands on the source code do whatever you like as long as you credit me appropriately and keep it open source.

Issues and pull requests are open but I don't know why you would ever need to use one of these. If you have any questions you can just leave a comment on my website or on any of [my contacts](https://pencilvoid.neocities.org/aboutme/#otherplaces).
