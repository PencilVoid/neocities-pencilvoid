      A pixel art drawing depicting two Undertale/Deltarune characters. On the left is the fan character Togore Dreemurr, an anthropomorphic creature with white fur who vaguely resembles a goat. He is wearing a green shirt with a yellow stripe and black trousers. He appears from a slightly raised angle. On the right is December Holiday, an anthropomorphic deer. She has no canon appearance as of publishing but the drawing presents a visual concept. She is drawn in monochrome, wearing a white short sleeve shirt and black trousers. In her left hand is a bat which is white with a red outline and has a red stain on it. Her antlers are white with blue outlines and her face is obscured by blue rectangles. She is leaning backwards slightly, and her head is tilted downwards with her right arm raised and pointing forwards. There are red circles on both sides of her palms. Each of her wrists has a single pixel wide blue line overlaid on it.

<p>
	Recently I've been thinking about Toby Fox's sense of character design so between more important things I tried drawing how I picture Dess in my head. I drew from multiple Deltarune characters and the unique visual for the lost souls from Undertale. I also came up with three different palettes because I couldn't decide which worked best. I don't know why Togore is there
