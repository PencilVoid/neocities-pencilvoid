    image-description: >-
      A digital drawing of the anthropomorphic deer character Ocha. She has brown fur with tan countershading on her face and neck. She also has purple eyes and light blonde hair with green undertones. She has two distinctive birch tree growths on her head, similar in appearance to antlers. She is wearing a dark blue skirt and a light blue blouse with a blue tie. She is holding a plastic cup of caramel-coloured boba tea and a black straw in her right hand, and her left hand is raised to her face. Her head is turned to her left, and she is looking in that direction with an open smile.

	Just Ocha being cute. Outfit design isn't my strong suit but I like how this one turned out.
