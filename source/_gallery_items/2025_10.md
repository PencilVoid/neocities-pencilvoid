      Digital drawing depicting the anthropomorphic pine tree Yona.
    image-description: >-
      A digital drawing showing Yona, an anthropomorphic pine tree. He is wearing a sleveless purple dress with gold accents, the dress tapering into a long loincloth which exposes his legs. Underneath the dress is a dark pink bodysuit, covering most of his thighs. He is also wearing white and grey mechanical "shoes". He is facing towards the right with his left knee raised and his right leg straight. His left hand is raised level with his shoulders, with his thumb and pinky fingers extended and the rest curled. His right hand is outstretched downwards in a "grabbing" motion. His back is arched slightly, and his head is turned to the left. He has a neutral expression with his mouth not visible and his eyes wide open with piercing blue pupils and sharp eyelashes. His hair is thrown behind him and curved upwards. His tail appears to the left behind him and curves downwards between his legs. Two of his rockets are circling behind him.

	Earlier I stumbled across an unfinished drawing of Yona I was planning for Halloween of 2024, but didn't finish because I wasn't vibing with it that much. I liked the pose I chose, so I decided to redraw it with a different outfit.
