      Digital drawing depicting the anthropomorphic sheep chimera character Hydra.
    image-description: >-
      A digital drawing of Hydra, an anthropomorphic sheep with a tail made of green plant matter. They are sitting on a not very detailed red bed, with a box on the floor next to them. In the box is a handgun, a crossbow, a red bra, and miscellaneous items. They are inspecting some red panties with a heart-shaped cutout. Their expression is blank, but a question mark next to them suggests confusion. Behind them on the bed is a rocket launcher, presumably part of the gift. Towards the upper left is a small doodle of Hydra wearing a quite goofy-looking heart costume, with their arms and legs sticking out of the sides and their face in the centre of the heart.

	Fifth weekly drawing of 2025! Of course I had to do something at least vaguely Valentine's Day-themed. Here, Hydra the chimera has received some gifts from a secret admirer... Between a handgun, a crossbow, and a rocket launcher, whoever gave it to them clearly knows the way to their heart.
