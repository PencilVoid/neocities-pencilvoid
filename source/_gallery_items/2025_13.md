      Digital drawing depicting the anthropomorphic pine tree Yona and the sun.
    image-description: >-
      A digital drawing of the anthropomorphic pine tree Yona, viewed from behind as he points a finger at the sun accusingly. He is wearing purple latex shorts under a purple and gold robe which is mostly obscured by his long green hair. He is also wearing white and grey mechanical boots, and four rocket thrusters float behind him. The sun seems unphased by this. Towards the bottom of the image an orange cow and the top half of a bomb falling on something out of frame can be seen.

She has two "fins" on the side of her head and her hair forms two similar shapes on her forehead, the rest of it sitting on her hea dbeing large and a bit frizzy. Her eyes have multiple rings surrounding her pupils, and she has long eyelashes. She has six whiskers on her snout, and her mouth isn't visible.

Both hands are balled into fists, and his left hand is raised while his right hand is outstretched to the side. He has a simple smile on his face.

<p>
	I didn't have the time for much this week, but I did participate in a fun Drawpile event! I'm not very used to the program but I enjoyed drawing alongside others regardless.

	The sun in the second image wasn't drawn by me, but I included it to contextualise my doodle a bit.
