    image-description: >-
      A digital drawing of the anthropomorphic algae Rho Donne. She has green skin and large, flowy pink hair. Her lower half is a teal mermaid tail, which curves upwards into a darker teal fin. She has two fins on the side of her head, with a fluorescent membrane connecting them. She is wearing a purple bandeau, and she sits in a bathtum with her elbows resting on the rim. The bathtub is on wheels, and has a steering wheel at the front between the taps and an exhaust pipe on the back. Text in the upper left reads "mario kart leak".
