      Pixel art piece depicting the anthropomorphic sheep character Afine.
    image-description: >-
      A pixel art drawing showing Afine, an anthropomorphic sheep. He has grey skin, brown curled horns, light blue hair, and a tail the same colour as his hair. He is wearing a dark blue leotard and holding a red triangular street sign in his left hand, which he swings backwards. His body is facing to the viewer's right, with his left knee raised and his right leg straight. His head is turned to the viewer's left and angled upwards. A light blue and pink liquid with white streaks trails from the tip of the street sign. There are also some splatters of pink liquid on Afine's horns and hair. The image is letterboxed with a beige checkerboard pattern; text written in Vianaic at the top of the image reads "no gods" and text written at the bottom of the image in Vianaic reads "no kings". There are QR codes in the top right and bottom left corners, for flair.

	I came up with this one pretty early in the month but it took me a while to figure out how I wanted to execute it.

	I hope you are all staying safe and happy this month. Oftentimes you will run into people who seem to want nothing other than to make your existence hell. Remember that your body and mind are a lot stronger than you think. The first step to prevailing against outstanding odds is to believe in yourself.
