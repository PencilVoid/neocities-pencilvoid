    image-description: >-
      A digital drawing of the anthropomorphic deer character Ocha. She has brown fur with tan countershading on her face and neck, and light blonde hair. She has two antlers which are similar in appearance to birch trees, with leaves growing on them. She is wearing a purple jumper and a black skirt which reaches halfway down her calves. She is sitting and holding a white cup which is maybe made of styrofoam I'm not sure. She is smiling with her eyes closed and her head is tilted slightly downwards. Her large bristly tail is curled downwards and to her right.

	Drew Ocha for no reason in particular. It's nice to draw a slightly more challenging perspective every once in a while.
