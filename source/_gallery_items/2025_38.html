      A digital drawing of the anthropomorphic pine tree character Yona. He has green skin with black forearms and long, spiky green hair. His eyes have white pupils and blue sclera. He is wearing a long white dress with a sort of small poncho thing in orange on top. His hands are on his hips and his head is tilted upwards, looking down at the viewer.

	I missed drawing Yona so I drew him. Believe it or not you're actually allowed to draw your sona whenever you want for free. I feel like I naturally gravitate towards drawing him with his hands on his hips/doing the Skinner "pathetic" meme at the viewer
