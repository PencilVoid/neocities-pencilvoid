      A pixel art drawing of Afine, an anthropomorphic sheep. He is seen sitting with his legs to the side, wearing a bra and skirt made of a translucent pink material with purple rims. He is also wearing a similar purple necklace around his neck. The lighting gives his hair and horns a slightly purple colouration. The background is abstract, with colours and shapes reminiscent of a beach.

      The same image as before, but with a darker colour scheme for the background. It has a slightly colder tint, as if to represent nighttime.

	A vaporwave-y drawing of my character Afine. I've been listening to a lot of vaporwave music recently which inspired the subject matter and colour choices. This started out as a simple warm-up sketch but I got carried away with the rendering and details... I don't do so that often so it's nice to get some practice in that regard once in a while.
