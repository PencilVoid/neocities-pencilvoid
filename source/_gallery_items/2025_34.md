	I was initially thinking of doing a sona drawing for this week but Kart Krew decided to obliterate my plans for this week by releasing an update for <a href="https://www.kartkrew.org/" target="_blank">Dr. Robotnik's Ring Racers.</a> I updated a follower I made some time ago to match the game's style more closely!
