      A pixel art drawing showing Zerda, an anthropomorphic fennex fox. They are shown in greyscale, with blue shading and outlines. Their electrostatic arms are shown in yellow and green; their left arm is throwing a punch to their side. They are wearing a baggy hoodie and somewhat baggier trousers, with the trousers having darker shading than the hoodie. On their head is a beanie, their ears and a few tufts of hair coming from under it. They have a furrowed brow and their mouth isn't visible.

	I actually nearly forgot this week because I was a bit busy with other things... so I did a quick little doodle of a character I haven't drawn in a while.
