      A pixel art drawing showing an anthropomorphic pine tree, vaguely hedgehog-like in appearance. He is wearing a light blue shirt and a dark blue skirt. His body is green, with his hair being a darker green and his tail, forearms, calves, and feet being a dark navy blue. His hair is long and flows down his back, almost reaching his knees. His arms are crossed, and his left knee is raised upwards while his right leg is straight.
