    image-description: >-
      A digital drawing of the anthropomorphic ferret character Xenia. She has beige and tan fur, and brown hair on her head. She is wearing a red jacket with a yellow vest under, and dark brown trousers with an orange belt. She has blue glasses on her face. She is holding a simplistic handgun above her head with both hands; a muzzle flash and a trail of smoke show she has fired a bullet in front of her. Her head is turned to her side and she is looking in the direction of fire.

	Second weekly drawing of 2025, featuring Xenia, a character of mine I don't draw nearly as much as I should.
