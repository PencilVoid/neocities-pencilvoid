      A digital drawing of a Sonic-styled cartoon isopod, called Misun. He has grey skin and a light teal shell. He is wearing green boots with gold buckles and on one hand a white glove with a gold wristband. On the other hand he wears a large cartoonish grey drill. He is raising the drill up and looking towards the viewer. He is depicted against a blue checkerboard background.

<p>
	For 2025 I'm trying to do at least one drawing a week, for the entire year (skipping the first two weeks). Week 1's drawing is of my Sonic the Hedgehog original character, Misun.
