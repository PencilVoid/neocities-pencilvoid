    image-description: >-
      An isometric image of a Minecraft-style 3D model of a crafting table with a unique design. The table stands on four legs rather than being a solid cube. A cloth with a grid pattern is draped on top of the table, and a saw and hammer are hung on one side. In the other visible side, a cavity containing some open books can be seen.

<p>
	A Minecraft model I made inspired by an art piece from <a href="https://shockpine.itch.io/" target="_blank">Shockpine</a>. The model doesn't work very well in-game due to technical reasons.
