      A digital drawing of a bust of the anthropomorphic deer character Ocha. She has brown fur with tan countershading on her face, neck, and chest. She also has purple eyes and light blonde hair with green undertones. The inside of her ears are pink. She is seen with two birch tree branches sprouting out of her head like antlers. She is facing slightly to the left of the viewer and looking to her left with a blank expression.

	Fourth weekly drawing of 2025. A simple doodle of a concept that's been rolling around in my haed for a while, where I try and think of ways to make it more obvious that Ocha is a plant/animal symbiote and maybe an oblivious forest spirit and definitely a freak of nature.
