      Digital drawing depicting the anthropomorphic deer Ocha.
    image-description: >-
      A digital drawing of the anthropomorphic deer character Ocha. She has brown fur with tan countershading on her face and neck, and light blonde hair. She has two antlers which appear similarly to birch trees, with leaves in various autumnal colours growing on them. She is wearing a witch outfit consisting of a black dress and witch hat. The dress extends nearly to her feet, but leaves a sliver of purple stockings visible. She is holding and looking down at a white sheet with eye holes cut out. To the right is a thought bubble showing Ocha imagining herself wearing it. She looks like some kind of bug in the thought bubble

      Multiple crude sketches of Ocha. In the centre is her in a similar pose to the previous image, and to the right is her wearing the sheet similarly to how she appears in the thought bubble in the previous image. To the left is her wearing a witch hat and holding some kind of basket, and at the bottom is her wearing a witch hat and sitting on a broomstick which is presumably floating.

	Are you looking forward to Halloween? Ocha's already gotten to picking out her costume...

	The second image is just some random doodles I did that I thought would be fun to include.
