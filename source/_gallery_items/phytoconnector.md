      A digital art piece depicting a desktop-sized machine, in a rough isometric view. It has a dark grey baseplate with a power cord plugged into the side. On top of the baseplate is a lighter grey box. The box is connected to the baseplate by two smaller red and blue boxes. On the side of the box are two small, square buttons. Red, blue, and green lights can be seen on the upper edge of the box, alongside a blue switch. The box holds a bulb of plant-like mass, connected to it by a short, square shaft. The bulb is bright green and has a sheen. Pronounced contours and folds can be seen in the bulb, giving it a malleable appearance.

	It's like a keyboard for plants.

				Plants, and anthroviridians by extension, have the unique ability to communicate by transmitting chemicals through the flesh. This works surprisingly fast, being almost as fast as pure thought. This form of communication can be used to transmit not only text but images, concepts, emotions, and anything that can be formed into a thought.
			</p>
			<p>
				The phytoconnector was created as a simple and adaptable way to allow anthroviridians to interface with computers. A user must simply make physical contact with the bulb of plant mass and transmit the desired input to it. This method can simulate keyboard, mouse, or game controller input. If the operating system supports it, it also allows for advanced features such as controlling multiple pointers at once. Some phytoconnectors come with software that allows for customised inputs to be created, to further enhance usage.

				The phytoconnector in the image shown is designed for use alongside a desktop or laptop computer. There are designs which can be worn on the body, allowing the user to recline, stand up, or even walk around while operating a computer. Infrequently, phytoconnectors may provide audiovisual output, allowing for computers to be used discretely. The output of this method is not as "strong" as physical audiovisual output, however, so this technology is usually only used for mobile music players.
