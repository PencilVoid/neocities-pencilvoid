      Pixel art doodles of Ralsei, a character from Deltarune who vaguely resembles a goat. He has white fur with pink horns and long, floppy ears. He is wearing a green cloak with black sleeves and a downwards-pointing symbol on the front. He also wears glasses that are the same shade of green as his cloak. On the left, he is viewed from the side in a running pose with light motion smears on his feet. On the right, he is viewed from the front doing a salute with a smile on his face. As I write this I realise it doesn't really look like a salute but rather just his hand is on his forehead. Whatever

	Still a little busy so all I have for this week is some doodles of Ralsei from Deltarune I did in between other stuff. I'm fine with some entries in this series being a little rushed. As long as I'm doing at least one drawing every week I'm still doing far better than I was previously!
