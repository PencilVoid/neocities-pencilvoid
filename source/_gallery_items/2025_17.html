      Digital drawing depicting the anthropomorphic deer Ocha.
    image-description: >-
      A digital drawing of the anthropomorphic deer character Ocha. She has brown and off-white fur, and beige hair. She has two antlers on her head, which are similar in appearance to the branches of a birch tree and have small green leaves on them. She is smiling with her eyes closed. The image is rendered with a limited selection of colours that alter Ocha's appearance slightly; her hair has strong green shading, and her lower face and torso fur are lighter than usual and also have green shading.

<p>
	I wanted to try doing something a little lower resolution for a change, so I did a little portrait of Ocha the deer. I tried something different with this one, where I picked a few colours from her usual colour scheme and put them together into one "ramp" to use for shading. I'm not totally in love with how it turned out; it looks a bit too similar to her normal colour scheme for the effect to come across well, but I'm glad I tried it regardless. Maybe it would work better on a character with a more diverse colour scheme.
