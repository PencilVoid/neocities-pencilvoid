      A pixel art drawing showing Afine, an anthropomorphic sheep. He is standing upright and facing the viewer head on, wearing a blue dress with a dark blue leotard underneath. In his left hand he holds a street sign which has been removed from the ground. The street sign is quite a bit taller than him and has a thin grey pole and a red triangular head. His other hand is at his hip and raised up slightly. He has grey hair and baby blue wool for hair, with wool of the same colour around his ankles. The background is a purple-pink cloudy pattern.

	Simple Afine doodle. I don't draw him with his stop sign enough.
