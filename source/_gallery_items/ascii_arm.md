      A greyscale ASCII art image of Sonic the Hedgehog in a 3/4 view. He is standing upright and staring straight forward into the distance with an expression of vague concentration. His left hand, which is further from the viewer, is held at his waist and the other hand is relaxed. Towards the upper right corner a signature written in normal text reads: "Sonic the Hedgehog; 2022-08-06; P.V."

	My first time messing around with ASCII art. Decided to go with a cool Sonic. Pretty proud of it, but Twitter totally butchered it with the compression. If the dithering looks strange, you can view it in full size by clicking on it.
