    image-description: >-
      A digital drawing of the anthropomorphic pine tree character Yona. He has green skin with black forearms, calves, hands, and feet. His hair and tail are a darker shade of green. He is wearing a blue skirt and a beige bandeau with a blue cloth tied around his shoulder and draped over his chest. His right hand is on his hip, and his left hand is pointing at something not pictured. His mouth is open and above his left hand is stretched out text which says "that". Below the space Yona is pointing at is a sketch of him wearing sunglasses with a neutral expression.
