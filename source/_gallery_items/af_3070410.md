    image-description: >-
      A pixel art piece depicting Satine, an anthropomorphic canine lady. She is sat at a brown table, resting her head on her hand and holding a cigarette in a cigarette holder. She is wearing a red dress, and looking at something out of frame towards the right of the viewer with an expression of disdain. The background consists of abstract purple streaks, vaguely resembling a beam of light cast by a stagelight.

	One of my Art Fight attacks from 2023. This one was a revenge attack, meaning I drew it in response to an attack I received. The terminology sounds aggressive but it's actually quite pleasant.
