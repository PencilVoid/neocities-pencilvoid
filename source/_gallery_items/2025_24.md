    image-description: >-
      A pixel art drawing showing a bust of Yona, an anthropomorphic pine tree. He has green skin and dark green hair. His hair is long and flowy, with part of it coming down onto his face, obscuring his right eye. The part dropping down has a spiked point on the end, and there is another spiked point behind his head. He has curved ears with points. His eyes have blue sclera and white pupils with a white ring around them. He has dark green eyelids and large, black eyelashes. He has a black nose and black lips. A blue cloth is tied around his shoulder. His bust is shown in a diamond shaped cutout with a blue background. The upper half of his head emerges from the cutout but the lower half is contained by it.

	I didn't really have any ideas for this week, so I decided to balance my time between preparing for Art Fight and having my wallet obliterated by Steam discounts (guess which won). Here is Yona's new icon, since his previous one doesn't really reflect how I draw him anymore.

	I will include my Art Fight submissions in the weekly drawing series but they'll have unique titles because I'm getting tired of the repetitive ones. (Leave a comment on my profile if you're interested in exchanging attacks!)
