      A screenshot of the game Minecraft, showing a player holding the mace model. The purple lines connecting the flanges are shown to have a translucent glowing effect in-game. The player is standing on a pink and black checkerboard pattern situated on a large stone platform floating in the void. Behind the player is a floor of ice surrounded by smooth stone slabs, a few doors and a small room with an entrance. Stone blocks stick out on the sides of the room and on top of the room are layers of snow and a platform made of white wool with red, green, and blue stained glass on top.

<p>
	It's my website and I get to decide what counts as a drawing!!!
</p>
<p>
	I recently revisited an old weapon model (a mace) I made for Minecraft and I liked the new version enough to decide it counts for the week's drawing. I had something else planned at first but progress on that was going slow enough that it probably would have ended up being finished next week anyways...
