    image-description: >-
      Pixel art depicting the anthropomorphic isopod Misun in various poses. In the upper left he is running to the right, his feet blurring and moving in a circle shape as he holds his drill hand at his side. He is looking forward with a neutral expression and his head tilted downwards slightly. In the upper right he is in the air with his legs split as he points his drill downwards, his left arm holding onto his right. In the bottom he charges forwards with his drill held in front of him as he twirls around it with heavy motion blur.
