      Digital drawing depicting the Business Manticore from Undertale.
    image-description: >-
      A digital drawing of the Business Manticore from Undertale. It is a vaguely feline creature drawn in dark blue monochrome; it has white fur and blue hair on its head. Its tail has a blue spiky thing on the end. It is wearing glasses and red high heels on its front legs. Next to it is a crudely drawn briefcase labelled "normal briefcase". To the right is a completely unrelated drawing of Frisk, a human. They are wearing a striped shirt, shorts, and blue boots. They have a neutral expression on their face, and their eyes are closed. They are holding a stick in their left hand.
