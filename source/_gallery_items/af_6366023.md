      A pixel art drawing depicting Palutina, an anthropomorphic sheep-like character. She has dark grey skin and yellowish off-white wool on her thighs, chest, and forearms. She is wearing a black bodysuit with blue accents and grey trims on the legs. She has grey and black armour on her calves and forearms, is wearing grey metallic headgear with grey and black ears and a blue visor attached. She has three eyes with the third being on her forehead, and her eyes take the appearance of white stars with no discernible pupils. She is smiling and the inside of her mouth is white. Her left knee is raised, and in her left hand she is holding a futuristic blade weapon with a dark grey staff and a translucent blue blade.
