      Pixel art depicting the characters Sonic the Hedgehog, Miles "Tails" Prower, and Knuckles the Echidna. All three are shown in a side view, their bodies tilted towards the viewer with their heads facing to the right. Sonic is in an "action" pose, his right foot raised as if preparing to run. He has a focused grin on his face. Tails is in a more neutral standing pose, smiling as his hands are held by his side. Knuckles has a more aloof pose, his gloved fists hanging by his side as he wears a neutral expression on his face.

<p>
	Third weekly drawing of 2025. Inspired by <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/tetraminose.bsky.social/post/3lgemeg236s2s" target="_blank">a Bluesky post from tetraminose</a>, I drew three Sonic the Hedgehog characters in sprites each 32 by 32 pixels. I picked the Windows XP MS Paint palette, one of my favourite palettes to use.
