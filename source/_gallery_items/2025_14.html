      Digital drawing depicting the anthropomorphic rabbit Miranmar.
    image-description: >-
      A digital drawing of the anthropomorphic rabbit Miranmar. She has grey fur and pastel pink hair. She is wearing a long sleeve shirt with puffy sleeves. The shirt is purple in its top half and blue in its bottom half. She is also wearing pink leggings, with a warmer pink skirt. She has brown sandals and a brown bag slung around her waist. She has a purple hat, which looks kind of like a beret but with the brim of a sunhat. The brim of her hat covers one of her eyes, the other is looking towards the viewer. She has a neutral expression on her face. Her right arm is at her side and her right knee is bent, as if making a stepping motion. Her left leg is straight and her left hand is held behind and above her head. A bright sparking light emanates from her left hand.

<p>
	I haven't drawn Mirannar in a while, so I took the opportunity to mess around with her design a bit.
