      A pixel art drawing depicting various objects. Towards the top is a strange sword, dark green in colour wih a double helix shaped blade which twists around a transpatent shard. It is labelled "Twisted Sword". In the left is a ready meal with a steak, fries, a large crumb of butterscotch pie, and a melty ice cream with a white cone. It is labelled "TV Dinner". In the centre is a black star-shaped object with pink shading and a red outline. A cross section of it is shown to the right, showing a dark red inside with a darker purple inner layer. It is labelled "Dark Candy". To the right is a similar star-shaped object, completely black in colour with a dark red and dark purple flame-like aura. It is labelled "Darker Candy?". In the bottom are two crystal-like objects. One is green and hexagonal shaped, labelled "Revive Mint". The other is orange, labelled "Tension Gem".
