      A digital drawing of an anthropomorphic deer. The drawing is in monochrome, but she has green eyes and green highlights in her hair. Her left leg is bent and her right leg is straight. She is looking at the viewer with a smile while making a pointing gesture with both hands. Her left hand is pointing upwards and her right hand is pointing to her side.
