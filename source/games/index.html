<p>
	Here is a small collection of games I made using <a href="https://www.construct.net/en/construct-2/download" target="_blank">Construct 2</a> back when I was newer to programming and game development. These games are dated from about 2018 according to their metadata, but they could be from earlier.

<p>
	Note: these games require keyboard input and are designed for desktop or laptop devices. Additionally, Super Turret Shooter requires mouse input for gameplay and The Open Road requires mouse input for navigating menus.

	<a href="/games/c2/antivirus">Antivirus</a>
	<br>
	A side-scrolling platformer/shooter. The levels quickly shift from actual gameplay to messing around.
</p>
<p>
	<a href="/games/c2/superTurretShooter">Super Turret Shooter</a>
	<br>
	A simple top-down shooter. There were experiments with switching between top-down and side-scrolling mid-level.
</p>
<p>
	<a href="/games/c2/theOpenRoad">The Open Road</a>
	<br>
	Top-down racing game in which the player competes with the clock.
