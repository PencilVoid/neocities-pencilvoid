      A drawing of Yona, an anthropomorphic pine tree similar in appearance to a hedgehog. He is wearing a white shirt, a short blue skirt, and boots. He is in the air and holding a stylised shotgun in one hand and a blade in the other. Being a plant, his hands are morphed to fit the items he's holding. His wings are flared upwards behind him.

<p>
	A slightly different sona drawing. I tried changing the colour of his eyes to make it clearer he isn't an animal. I also tried messing around with some filters, which I've collated into one image for your convenience (and mine).
