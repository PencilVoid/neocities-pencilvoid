    image-description: >-
      A pixel art piece depicting Ocha, an anthropomorphic deer woman. She is depicted against a dark background, peering into a fridge which she is holding open with one hand. The other hand is holding a bunch of stems and leaves, some of which have already made their way to her mouth. She is staring blankly at the viewer, as if to try and appear inconspicuous.

<p>
	Someone suggested I draw her "Binging leaves from the fridge at like 2 A.M." I'm kind of awful at gauging scale so she ended up looking tiny compared to the fridge.
