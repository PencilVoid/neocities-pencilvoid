      A digital art piece depicting the anthropomorphic pine tree Yona with an appearance similar to a hedgehog. He is wearing a beige low cut shirt and a teal pencil skirt. He is also wearing a grey mechanical part on his upper left arm, and two jet thrusters are floating behind him. He is walking forwards with a short gait and looking down towards his friend, the anthropomorphic deer Ocha. She is wearing a green sweater with a purple skirt and lighter purple leg warmers. Her light blonde hair is tied into a ponytail by a flower with light blue petals and two large green leaves. She is looking up at him and talking enthusiastically. Her right hand is gesturing and her left hand is held to her body, below her chest.

	I meant to do a little more with this one but I didn't and when I got back to it I decided it was fine as it was. Very rarely do I draw more than one character in one image.

	I promise Yona is very entertained, he just tends towards blank facial expressions.
