      A landscape pixel art of a clearing in a snowy forest at night. Green and purple shapes resembling auroras are visible in the sky, apparently emanating from a distant yet visible star. Two footprint tracks can be seen side by side in the thick snow. On the left, a fallen tree trunk can be seen.
