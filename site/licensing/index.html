<p>
	I want to be open about how I run my website, and allow people to learn from it and reuse it where appropriate. The best way to go about this is to be specific about what licenses I've chosen for this project. This allows me to give back to the indie web community in a way that I'm comfortable with and allows you to use some resources from this website with peace of mind.
</p>
<p>
	This document will outline licensing and permissions by <a href="https://github.com/PencilVoid/neocities-pencilvoid/tree/main/site" target="_blank">source files</a>.
</p>
<h2>
	Code
</h2>
<p>
	"Code" covers anything in /_layouts, /_includes, /_sass, /resources/scripts, and /resources/styles. Essentially, <b>any source code or interpreted code without substantial original writing mixed in</b>. Code in this context is licensed under <a href="https://opensource.org/license/0bsd" target="_blank">Zero-clause BSD</a>. It is provided with <b>no warranty</b>, which means that if you reuse it and something breaks I'm not responsible in any way. Otherwise, these resources can be reused and re-distributed freely without any conditions.
</p>
<h2>
	Game code
</h2>
<p>
	"Game code" refers to the code used by games in /games/c2. Each of these have the code contained in their own folders. All of them use jQuery, which is licensed under the <a href="https://fossa.com/blog/open-source-licenses-101-mit-license/" target="_blank">MIT License</a>. pathfind.js, in games where it is present, is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_rights_reserved" target="_blank">all rights reserved</a> by Scirra Ltd.
</p>
<p>
	I am yet to find reliable copyright information for c2runtime.js, data.js, offline.js, offlineClient.js, and sw.js. All other game code files are licensed under <a href="https://opensource.org/license/0bsd" target="_blank">Zero-clause BSD</a>.
</p>
<h2>
	Game assets
</h2>
<p>
	"Game assets" covers non-code resources used by games in /games/c2, e.g. images, sound effects. Antivirus and Super Turret Shooter consist entirely of original art, which is licensed under <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/" target="_blank" >CC BY-NC-SA 4.0</a>. This means that while you are allowed to reuse these assets and build upon them, you must not use them for commercial purposes, credit must be given to me, and you must allow others to reuse your derivative work upon the same or similar terms.
</p>
<h2>
	Gallery art
</h2>
<p>
	"Gallery art" refers to the works featured in /photosystems, and any other artwork featured on the site which is by me, e.g art in certain blog posts. These works are licensed under <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/?ref=chooser-v1" target="_blank">CC BY-NC-ND 4.0</a>. This means that you are permitted to redistribute these works <b>as long as you do not create your own derivative works from them</b> and you are redistributing them non-commercially. Additionally, attribution is required. Please understand that sometimes my artwork can be quite personal to me, and I choose a relatively strict license in order to allow myself to potentially loosen up in the future, rather than the other way around.
</p>
<h2>
	Miscellaneous site art
</h2>
<p>
	I like to occasionally decorate my site with raster or vector art, such as on the landing page or Esoterrarium page. This includes assets in /resources/images/decorations, and files beginning with "deco_" in /resources/images/eso. These are licensed under <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/" target="_blank" >CC BY-NC-SA 4.0</a>.
</p>
<h2>
	Blog posts
</h2>
<p>
	"Blog posts" actually refers to the articles in both Esoterrarium <em>and</em> SievePlate. This content is available under <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/" target="_blank" >CC BY-NC-SA 4.0</a>.
</p>
<h2>
	Writing, not including blog posts
</h2>
<p>
	"Writing" in this context refers to original prose, in the form of various articles or lists; the majority of content on this website. This does not include blog posts as described above. Various directories in this site have their own index pages, each containing what can be considered "writing." These typically have front matter defining things such as the title and header. With or without HTML tags, this content is licensed under <a href="https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/?ref=chooser-v1" target="_blank">CC0 1.0</a>. Go crazy.
</p>
<h2>
	Screenshots
</h2>
<p>
	Some articles utilise screenshots to show off content or illustrate a point. In cases where the screenshot depicts my own work, the screenshot inherits the license of the depicted work. Otherwise, the screenshot is licensed under <a href="https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/?ref=chooser-v1" target="_blank">CC0 1.0</a>. Regardless, you can ask for permission to reuse screenshots and I will probably let you.
