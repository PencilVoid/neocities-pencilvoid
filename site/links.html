            <h3>ðŸ“Œ16/Aug/2018 9:07 pm - THE "ABOUT"ðŸ“Œ</h3>
              <p>I originally created this site to test out my skills in HTML, and I went on with it for longer than i can remember. The styling you see on this site now is very different from what it was at the start. Originally, I styled the site using HTML styling tags and other terrible stuff. Now, I know the basics of CSS and I am able to style the website to a view that is much easier on the eyes. Speaking of "easier on the eyes", I was recently contemplating adding a dark mode to the site. I have decided that i will not, probably never will, and have instead added the system of each page on this site having a different background and colour pallette. The reason i went with this instead of dark mode is because I realised that I don't prefer themes that are neccessarily dark, but rather "easy on the eyes". The eyes being my eyes. I don't know what you prefer, but I'm hoping that you're OK with this. <em>Anyways........</em> another part of the history of this site is the part at the bottom of <a href="pencilvoid.neocities.org/index.html">index.html</a> that says "THE END... so far". That has been there since the start of this site. I think. I don't know. I'm not sure. Eh. It's definitely <ital>old</ital>. Very <ital>old</ital>. That's for sure. Im gonna finish up here for now because I'm tired and it's 9 pm. So, this is me, at 9:07 pm BST/8(10?):07 pm GMT, signing off.</p>
<h3>18/20/2019 8:18 pm - insert title here</h3>
  <p>Coding is a very exhausting business. I've made some changes that shouldn't look too different to anyone looking at the website, but quite different to anyone looking at the code.</p>
<h3>9/3/2019 4:14 pm - The CSS</h3>
  <p>I'm nearly done with the new CSS. By the time you're reading this. this page should have its own very special CSS! Contact me by email or anywhere else to tell me what you think.</p>
<h3>23/2/2019 9:23 pm - Quick update</h3>
 <p>So, I'm just writing this to let anyone following this site know that I'm planning to redo the CSS on this website. Every page will use the same stylesheet, but this page might have a special stylesheet<sub>once i figure out ninepatches</sub>.
          <h3>20/9/2018 7:42 pm - Secrets</h3>
            <p>I've got something planned.ðŸ˜‰ </p>
          <h3>23/6/2018 7:42 pm - Thought</h3>
            <p>These plans are taking longer than expected. Also, I should probably make this an RSS feed.<br><br>On an unrelated note, it's Sonic the Hedgehog's 28th anniversary! Happy birthday, Sonic!ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‚</p>
