excerpt: "<p>Thoughts on making it out alive.</p>"

	In tumultuous times it's pretty easy to lie down or sit on your hands, wishing the powers above you that control your life had things like "empathy" or "basic respect for humanity". This is an entirely normal reaction, and you're not wrong or evil for it. But what's most important is never giving it all up.

	The most important thing to you is to focus on the things that are immediate and directly in front of you; the things you can control. Any positive change you can effect in your own life will help keep you sane. Forming and strengthening community bonds is invaluable. Be there for others and they will be there for you.

<p>
	You probably hear people throw around "it gets better" often, and it really can sound like bullshit when you weigh your options and it seems like nothing works out in your favour. But really, the truth is as long as you are alive you will survive to see the sunrise. As long as your heart is beating, you can eat, breathe, and continue to exist.
</p>
<p>
	Everything you can do to make your own day or someone else's even a little bit better is worth it.
