<blockquote>
	<p>
		I met a traveller from an antique land<br>
		Who said: Two vast and trunkless legs of stone<br>
		Stand in the desart. Near them, on the sand,<br>
		Half sunk, a shattered visage lies, whose frown,<br>
		And wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command,<br>
		Tell that its sculptor well those passions read<br>
		Which yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things,<br>
		The hand that mocked them and the heart that fed:<br>
		And on the pedestal these words appear:<br>
		"My name is Districts, listing of listings:<br>
		Look on my site, ye Mighty, and despair!"<br>
		Nothing beside remains. Round the decay<br>
		Of that colossal wreck, boundless and bare<br>
		The lone and level rats stretch far away.

	Districts is gone. I am going to assume <a href="/sieveplate/2023/08/districts_retrospective/">my scathing review</a> manifested a drone strike which obliterated it from orbit, and left in its place a single rat. I attempted to contact the One Rat for interview, but it did nothing but spin around.

	What could this mean for Neocities? Will more sites be replaced by rats? Are rats going to take over the internet? As we all know, before Districts was tragically murdered it was the most-visited site in existence, surpassing YouTube at 24 trillion unique visitors every day. It makes sense that the One Rat would pick such a large target. Don't be surprised if you visit google.com only to find yourself redirtected[sic] to ratgoogle.com .............
