	Internet home of the world's best worst pixel artist and actual coniferous plant creature in real life- it's PencilVoid. Take a look around, get comfy.
</p>
<h2>
	Who/what/why are you?
</h2>
<p>
	I am a PencilVoid. As far as I know, I am the only person who is me.
</p>
<p>
	This place is a personal project that I became unexpectedly invested in. I've used this to learn basic web development and computer skills in general. It's been fun so far.
</p>
<p>
	This place is also a place for me to talk about the things I do. Most of my hobbies involve sitting in front of an oversized calculator and pressing buttons until it shows cool stuff on its display. This website is an example of that. Some things I do with my giant calculator include <a href="/art">pixel art</a> and amateur video game modding. I use tools like <a href="https://www.getpaint.net/index.html" target="_blank">paint.net</a> and <a href="https://www.blockbench.net/" target="_blank">Blockbench</a>. Conveniently, this site holds <a href="/esoterrarium/freestuff">a list</a> of tools I use alongside some tools I don't use but are cool nonetheless. Maybe check that out?
