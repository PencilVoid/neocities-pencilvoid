		<h2>Questions</h2>
			<h3>What are you?</h3>
			<p>My name is Hydra (or Pencil (or Eryth), whichever you prefer) and I'm a person. I do stuff. I'm a big nerd</p>
			<h3>What is this place?</h3>
			<p>This page, and the pages attached to it, are a personal project and a reflection of my own will. This is the result of my past being's ultimate will, desire, and ability, bestowed unto me and to be bestowed unto whatever iteration of me may exist in the misty realm we call the future. This place was, is, and will always be a reflection of many form of being, past, present, and future, brought to life by the good people at <a href="https://neocities.org/" target="_blank">Neocities</a>, giving me the means to give my creation form in the digital world. This page is a brew of DNA both original and <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/" target="_blank">stolen</a>, all I have to show for hours upon hours of banging my figurative head against the figurative wall. This is it. A constantly evolving end.</p>
			<h3>What stuff do you make?</h3>
			<p>I make pixel art and mod games. I also know HTMl and CSS, and I have limited but growing knowledge of storytelling, 3D modelling and game design/development.</p>
			<h3>What do you use to make the things?</h3>
			<p>For art I use <a href="https://www.getpaint.net/index.html" target="_blank">paint.net</a> and <a href="http://www.rw-designer.com/image-editor" target="_blank">Realworld Paint</a> if I need to. I also know how to work with <a href="https://slade.mancubus.net/" target="_blank">SLADE</a> and <a href="https://www.blockbench.net/" target="_blank">Blockbench</a>.</p>
			<h3>Obligatory credits section?</h3>
			<p>This place is currently hosted by <a href="https://neocities.org/" target="_blank">Neocities</a>, a project similar to Geocities which allows users to create and host web pages for free. The code that wasn't written in Neocities' own code editor was written in <a href="https://notepad-plus-plus.org/" target="_blank">Notepad++</a>, and I wish it was easier to incorporate Notepad++ into my workflow. HTML and CSS knowledge was provided by <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/" target="_blank">MDN Web Docs</a> and <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/" target="_blank">W3Schools</a>. Under the terms of the <a href="https://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&id=ofl" target="_blank">Open Font License</a> this website uses <a href="https://levien.com/type/myfonts/inconsolata.html" target="_blank">Inconsolata</a> for headings and <a href="https://overpassfont.org/" target="_blank">Overpass</a> for body text. All art and other creative content featured on this website, unless stated otherwise, were created by me.</p>
