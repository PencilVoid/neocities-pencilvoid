				Wow, I can draw. Amazing. It's mostly pixel art. I've been doing pixel art for a while now and I'm fairly okay at it. I only ever draw for fun so it's mostly character art featuring my OCs (no write-ups on any of them, learn about them by playing the games they will eventually be in). I'm best at drawing anthropomorphic animals for some reason. I can count the amount of humans I've drawn on one hand. I do have some characters that aren't Funny Animals though. There's also occasional vector art and graphic design work but I don't do that frequently enough to feature anything on this page. All the vector assets this site uses were made by me though.
