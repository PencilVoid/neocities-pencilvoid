		You feel confused. You've found yourself in a strange, new place. There's green stuff everywhere and it's weirdly bright. You rub the crust off your eyes and rise to your feet.
	</p>
	<p>
		Squinting, you calibrate yourself and begin to get an idea of your surroundings. It seems you've made your way to a huge... garden? Botanical reserve? Some random forest??? There's a strange semblence of human architecture, but it's clear to you the flora and fauna own this realm. As you make your way through the land, you could swear you almost feel someone, or something, trying to communicate.
	</p>
	<p>
		Was it speaking to you? Regardless of how it communicates, it's making something known to you. Slowly, you get an idea that there's something here with you. Something like a gateway, or a portal. And it brought friends. When you stand over them and peer down into them you see nothing your visual recognition can parse, but the <em>idea</em> of the place it leads to floods your mind. Highly unsettling, but intriguing. Maybe you can use these to explore this place a little further?
