			<p>You feel confused. You've found yourself in a strange, new place. There's green stuff everywhere and it's weirdly bright. You rub the crust off your eyes and stand on your feet.</p>
			<br>
			<p>You look around and see you've made your way to a huge, sprawling garden. There's a strange semblence of human architecture, but it's clear to you the flora and fauna own this realm. As you make your way through the land, you get the feeling there's somehow raw, pure thoughts strewn around. It seems to you you can't see them, but you intuit that they're communicated directly to your brain due to their nature as thoughts. Evidently, there are also hyperlinks strewn across the place. You have no idea how you know what a hyperlink is, or how you know they're hyperlinks, but the thought is sure of itself.</p>
