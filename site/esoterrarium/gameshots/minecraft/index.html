				I didn't build this... but I took this screenshot, and that's enough. This was in a server that isn't available on, built and owned by two lovely friends of mine. It was situated in a lush cave that had been spawnproofed and converted to a beautiful base. Taken in 1.18.x with <a href="https://sildurs-shaders.github.io/" target="_blank">Sildur's Vibrant Shaders</a>.

				OK, this one <em>is</em> my doing, so I don't want to see any complaints. This is my little port, at night, in a grand server I play on named <a href="https://www.prismparty.net/" target="_blank">Prism Party</a>. Ignore the frozen water, I forgot Frost Walker ice doesn't thaw at night. Taken in 1.18.2 with <a href="https://sildurs-shaders.github.io/" target="_blank">Sildur's Vibrant Shaders</a>.

				Another one taken on Prism Party. This is a Lush Cave I found and then shoved some random stuff in. <a href="https://github.com/ckosmic/minecraft-psx" target="_blank">The shader pack</a> I used here gave it a nice misty appearance.
