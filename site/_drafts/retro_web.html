	I'll begin with one simple statement: the yesterweb/"web 1.0" movement is, in my opinion, misguided and blinded by nostalgia.

	If you're reading this you probably use <a href="https://neocities.org/" target="_blank">Neocities</a> (which currently hosts this website) or are at least aware it exists. If not, Neocities is a free personal web hosting service. The site aims to provide a platform for free self-expression and creativity, the supposed antithesis of the modern web. The prospect of a space online that's entirely yours is understandably very attractive to many people, and as such Neocities attracts users in droves.
</p>
<p>
	Oftentimes on other platforms I'll see a post soapboxing and basically urging readers to join Neocities immediately. Maybe they'll even link to some helpful developer resources like <a href="https://sadgrl.online/webmastery/" target="_blank">sadgrl.online's webmastery resources</a> or <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/" target="_blank">W3Schools</a>. I really do hate to make assumptions (much less incorrect assumptions) but I can't help but assume that these posts are more often than not written by people in the "honeymoon" phase of their Neocities journey.
</p>
<p>
	To be honest, it does sadden me a little to see a site on Neocities that clearly had a lot of effort and care put into it but hasn't been updated in a year or possibly longer. The webmaster most likely retreated to social media. But, I do wonder sometimes: <i>if your website really meant that much to you, why did you abandon it?</i> 
</p>
<p>
	I don't mean to be unrealistic. I know that very often life gets in the way and prevents people from tending to personal projects (my site updates relatively frequently due to a lack of the aforementioned). But it is quite frequently that I spot someone who manages to update frequently on social media and yet their website on Neocities is stale and failing to meet recent OSHA guidelines.
