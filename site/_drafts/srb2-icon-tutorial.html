	Here is a simple and relatively easy way to use SRB2's WAD and PK3 icons in File Explorer on Windows.

<p>
	I can confirm this works in Windows 10 and 11. Can't make any guarantees for earlier versions of Windows or other operating systems. Additionally, it's permanent. As far as I know there isn't any way to revert it to the icon it was using previously other than locating the ICO file yourself. Only do this is you are very sure you want every WAD and PK3 on your computer to be a reference to SRB2 until the end of time!!!

	First, we need to prepare our ICO files. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICO_(file_format)" target="_blank">ICO file format</a> is a type of image file that Windows uses to visualise files, folders, and programs. These are used in File Explorer and places like the desktop and taskbar.
</p>
<p>
	Making an ICO file requires specialised software due to the way it stores the image data. But thankfully you don't have to worry about that. I've already made them so you can go ahead and <a href="" target="_blank">download them here</a>. Put them somewhere easy to find and <strong>remember where you put them</strong>!
</p>
<p>
	You'll need to download one software tool for this: <a href="https://www.nirsoft.net/utils/file_types_manager.html" target="_blank">FileTypesMan</a> by Nir Sofer. This is a free software utility that allows you to modify the data associated with each file type your operating system knows about. Download the version appropriate for your operating system. If you're unsure which version to download: get the x64 version on Windows 11, get the x86 ("normal") version on any other version of Windows.

	FileTypesMan requires no installation and the files can be put anywhere. I would recommend creating a folder for it in your Documents folder as shown in Figure 2.
