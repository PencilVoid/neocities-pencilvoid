    Image: Shaded fullbody drawing of Miranmar, an anthropomorphic pink rabbit lady, in a purple dress with cyan leggings, earrings, and bracelets. She's posing for the camera, smiling and holding up two V signs with her fingers. The background is abstract, featuring grey circles and the text &quot;Year of the Rabbit; MMXXIII (2023)&quot;.

    I totally messed up the "Go The Entirety Of 2023 Without Drawing" challenge. Miran is fun to draw though, and it's her year anyways.

    Image: Fullbody image of Midnight Ophelia, a black Cat Viskian. She is walking towards the left with her head turned to her right, looking behind her. She is making a gesture with her left hand. Her right hand is on her hip. Towards the uper left corner of the image there is also a portrait drawing of her. She is looking at the viewer with her head tilted up slightly and sticking her tongue out.

    ASCII art of Classic Sonic. Pretty proud of it, but Twitter totally butchered it with the compression. (HIGHLY recommend opening in a new tab to view at original size, downscaling messes with the dithering)

    Image: Landscape pixel art of a clearing in a snowy forest at night. Green and purple clouds are visible in the sky, apparently emanating from a distant yet visible star. Two footprint tracks can be seen side by side in the thick snow. On the left, a fallen tree trunk can be seen.

    A little landscape piece. I intended for it to have a sketchy look but it got more polished as I went on.
