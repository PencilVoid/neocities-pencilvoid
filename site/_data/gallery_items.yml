    I totally messed up the "Go The Entirety Of 2023 Without Drawing" challenge. Miran is fun to draw though, and it's her year anyways.

She is wearing a red dress, and looking at something out of frame towards the right of the viewer with an expression of disdain. The background consists of abstract purple streaks, vaguely resembling a beam of light cast by a stagelight.

    This one is probably the longest I've ever spent on an artwork. I finished it around a month after I started it. (just in time for Halloween!) The Spamton Sweepstakes were a whole lot of fun.

        A mural-like pixel art piece depicting various Deltarune references. In the centre Kris Dreemurr is seen, in a reclining pose. Their face is non-articulated and they are wearing Spamton's signature glasses on their forehead. Below them, Susie can be seen falling downwards, into the direction the viewer is facing. Multiple miscellanous objects can be seen: sheets of paper, an egg, some pipis, Lancer plushies, a guitar, a framed picture of the Annoying Dog, ICE-E, a chair with a blue sheet caught on it, a blue closet, a changing room curtain, a half-illuminated television set, a golden Berdly statue, some holly and baubles, a green room, and a scarlet tree. Streaming across the image in the background is an abstract piano keyboard. A low-detail blog post tiles across the black background of the image.

      <p>
        Plants, and anthroviridians by extension, have the unique ability to communicate by transmitting chemicals through the flesh. This works surprisingly fast, being almost as fast as pure thought. This form of communication can be used to transmit not only text but images, concepts, emotions, and anything that can be formed into a thought.
      </p>
      <p>
        The phytoconnector was created as a simple and adaptable way to allow anthroviridians to interface with computers. A user must simply make physical contact with the bulb of plant mass and transmit the desired input to it. This method can simulate keyboard, mouse, or game controller input. If the operating system supports it, it also allows for advanced features such as controlling multiple pointers at once. Some phytoconnectors come with software that allows for customised inputs to be created, to further enhance usage.
      </p>
      <p>
        The phytoconnector in the image shown is designed for use alongside a desktop or laptop computer. There are designs which can be worn on the body, allowing the user to recline, stand up, or even walk around while operating a computer. Infrequently, phytoconnectors may provide audiovisual output, allowing for computers to be used discretely. The output of this method is not as "strong" as physical audiovisual output, however, so this technology is usually only used for mobile music players.

Red, blue, and green lights can be seen on the upper edge of the box, alongside a blue switch. The box holds a bulb of plant-like mass, connected to it by a short, square shaft. The bulb is bright green and has a sheen. Pronounced contours and folds can be seen in the bulb, giving it a malleable appearance..
