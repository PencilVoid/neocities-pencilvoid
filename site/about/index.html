	<h2>
		The site
	</h2>
	<p>
		This site was first uploaded to Neocities on 22 June 2018. It looked <em>very</em> different back then. Over time it has grown and developed clear design goals:
		<ul>
			<li>Be lightweight. The site is primarily text content. Use vector assets or CSS where possible; raster graphics should be relatively low resolution with relatively low colour count.</li>
			<li>Be straightforward. Convey information with brevity and clarity, minimise unnnecessary and extraneous details.</li>
			<li>Be stylish. Aesthetics should not be forgone entirely.</li>
			<li>Be accessible. The site should be approachable by anyone and everyone.</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
	<p>
		I like to think I've worked towards these goals well. The site will host a wide range of content: pixel art, writing, code, games, etc. It is a central hub for all my creative work.
	</p>
	<p>

	<h2>
		Me
	</h2>
	<p>
		I do a lot of creative work in my spare time. I like learning new skills and I like improving through the process of iteration. I tend to gravitate towards creative work that is conducive to iteration for that reason; namely pixel art and programming.
	</p>
	<p>
		Some of my other interests include retro computing, late 90s/early 2000s-style video games, tracker music, biology, botany and horticulture, and game development.
	</p>
	<p>For your interest, I've made a short list of some of my favourite things:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Music pieces:</li>
		<ul>
			<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4EL70Vs1sE" target="_blank">C418 - Excuse</a></li>
			<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ45EWhhtHc" target="_blank">Ruby My Dear - Kismet</a></li>
			<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLHtV_S2HZw" target="_blank">Aphex Twin - IZ-US</a></li>
			<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3R2XGxbpPNs" target="_blank">Machine Girl - Hidden Power (Phase Î´)</a></li>
			<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QyBGvZ0pHM" target="_blank">Caravan Palace - Lay Down</a></li>
		</ul>
		<li>Video games:</li>
		<ul>
			<li><a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us" target="_blank">Minecraft</a></li>
			<li><a href="https://www.srb2.org/" target="_blank">Sonic Robo Blast 2</a></li>
			<li><a href="https://devilmayquake.com/" target="_blank">Ultrakill</a></li>
			<li><a href="https://marbleblast.com/" target="_blank">PlatinumQuest</a></li>
		</ul>
		<li>Animals:</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Fennec foxes</li>
			<li>Rabbits (I have read <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watership_Down" target="_blank">Watership Down</a> multiple times)</li>
			<li>Sheep</li>
		</ul>
		<li>Colours:</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Green (very versatile)</li>
			<ul>
				<li>Specifically, my favourite greens are cooler greens like seafoam or mint. Any shade or tint of green is nice to look at, though.</li>
			</ul>
			<li>Purple</li>
		</ul>
	</ul>
	<p>
		"PencilVoid" works fine enough if you need a noun to refer to me by. Contractions are also fine; people usually go for "Pencil", "Void", or "PV".

	<p>
		I'm open to make new friends. Just contact me if you wanna greet me or have anything to say.
	</p>
	<p>
		I've been doing pixel art for over seven years (since 12 November 2016 (don't ask why I keep a precise date)), and I think I've gotten somewhat good at it. I'm always willing to help people with anything. Feel free to ask me any questions about things like pixel art or web development.
