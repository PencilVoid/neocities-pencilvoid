	These are games I've made over the years. The three here currently were made when I was pretty young and pretty stupid. I'll update this directory eventually, once I find the time and motivation to get better at <a href="https://godotengine.org/" target="_blank">Godot</a> and gamedev stops being such a daunting task to me.

	Note: these games require keyboard input and are designed for desktop or laptop devices. Additionally, Super Turret Shooter requires mouse input for gameplay and The Open Road requires mouse input for navigating menus.
